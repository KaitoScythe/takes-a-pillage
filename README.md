# It Takes A Pillage
> Advancing the pillager civilization.

Herein lies my changelog and motivation for developing a mod for Minecraft aiming to advance the capabilities of the pillager civilization, as well as provide additional challenges and compelling gameplay in the survival game mode.

## Motivation

Modifications and additions to pillager structure spawning offer wide potential to introduce new lore implications.

I will add a new structure, called pillager camps, that spawn in the overworld. These are a medium-sized pillager base scattered throughout flat terrain, with additional loot and enemies.

I will add bastilles to the overworld. These are firmer pillager establishments, where prisoners and pillaged loot are brought.

These new structures need new enemies. Vanilla-themed variations on the pillager will patrol these structures, including the archer, skirmisher, and legioner.

Pillagers won't only sit idly waiting for a player with bad omen to attack a village. Sieges on villages can occur any night.

## Changelog

### Items
* Added a ravager horn, one of which is always dropped by slain ravagers. Its use will give the player the bad omen effect
* Added the "Bastille Blues" music disc, by izofar
* Added spawn eggs for each respective mob
* Drinking milk no longer removes bad omen (configurable)

### Mobs
* Added the Archer, a quick, hooded pillager that wields a bow
* Added the Skirmisher, a very fast, axe-wielding pillager with limited visibility
* Added the Legioner, an armored pillager equipped with sword and shield
* Added the Clay Golem, a weaker but faster golem that is cheaper to summon

### World
* Pillager encampments now generate over flat terrain in the overworld
* Bastilles now generate over flat terrain in the overworld
* Pillage sieges may now happen in villages during nighttime
* Natural iron golem spawning has been replaced by clay golems (configurable)

### GUI
* Added Advancements to be achieved by exploring *It Takes a Pillage*
